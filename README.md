# KYKD Script Generator

To aid volunteer training and operations efforts for the KYKD radio administrators, This project generates the daily script files used by KYKD for the daylight and tides announcements.

## Project Goals

- Faithfully follow KYKD’s 2026 script procedures
- Produce consistent, error-free scripts
- Allow volunteers to record announcements without needing training in the phrasing rules
- Keep the system transparent and simple so that future adjustments are easy to make

## About KYKD

Voice For Christ Ministries exists to provide Christian radio to Native and Rural Alaskans.

VFCM believes that radio is the most effective means to spread Biblical teaching and the gospel of Jesus Christ in the state of Alaska. Radio can overcome the obstacles of Alaska's vast size, the harsh and unpredictable weather, and the cultural barriers amongst Native and non-Native rural residents.

Alaska's land mass is approximately equal to one-fifth of the lower 48 states. With 570,374 square miles or 365,039,104 acres, Alaska is the largest state in the union, just over twice the size of Texas. With only three state highways, travel by road in Alaska can be difficult.
