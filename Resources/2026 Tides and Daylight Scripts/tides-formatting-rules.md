# Tides Script Formatting Rules

## Daily Files

Each day requires two script files:

- **Tides-M** — for broadcasts between **7:08 a.m. and 11:08 a.m.**
- **Tides-E** — for broadcasts between **7:08 p.m. and 11:08 p.m.**

Naming format:

    MM-DD-Tides-M
    MM-DD-Tides-E

## Sunlight Data Formatting

Sunrise, sunset, and daylight duration must use grammar that matches when the event occurs relative to the broadcast window, not when the script is recorded.

### Sunrise Rules (Morning File)

Broadcast window: 6:08 a.m. to 11:08 a.m.

| Sunrise Time | Formatting Rule |
|--------------|----------------|
| Before 6:08 a.m. | Use past tense: “The sun rose this morning in Bethel at HH:MM a.m.” |
| Within window | Use no verb: “Sunrise this morning in Bethel, HH:MM a.m.” |

### Sunset Rules (Evening File)

Broadcast window: 6:08 p.m. to 11:08 p.m.

| Sunset Time | Formatting Rule |
|-------------|----------------|
| Before 6:08 p.m. | Use past tense: “The sun set in Bethel this afternoon/evening at HH:MM p.m.” |
| Within window | Use no verb: “And sunset time in Bethel, HH:MM p.m.” |
| After 11:08 p.m. but before midnight | Use future tense: “…and the sun will set this evening at HH:MM p.m.” |
| After midnight | Use this phrasing: “…and the sun will set at XX minutes after midnight.” |

### Daylight Duration Rules

Match the tense to how sunset relates to the window:

| Sunset Timing | Rule |
|---------------|------|
| Before window | “That gave us … hours …” |
| During window | “Giving us … hours …” |
| After window | “That will give us … hours …” |

## Tide Data Formatting

Each script includes three predicted tides for each location.

### Selecting the First Tide

Always start with the first tide occurring during or after the broadcast window.

### Grammar Rules

| Tide Timing | Rule |
|-------------|------|
| No tide occurs during the window | Use future tense: “The next high tide at Bethel will be at HH:MM…” |
| First tide occurs inside the window | Use no past/future verbs (the recording plays before and after the event). Example: “The tide tables for Quinhagak show a low tide at HH:MM…” |

### Location-Specific Notes

For Togiak, use published data for Black Rock Island and label it accordingly:

    “The tides for Togiak at Black Rock…”
